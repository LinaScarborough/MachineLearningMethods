# 3 Model 3: Binomial GLM
# We constructed a binomial generalized linear model to estimate the likelihood of dog sex
# (coded as 1 for male and 2 for female) based on the predictor DogAgeCoded. The goal was to identify
# if there is a significant relationship between dog age and the likelihood of being male or female.

"""
The coefficient for DogAgeCoded is 0.0035 with a p-value of 0.0104, indicating statistical significance.
For every year increase in dog age, the probability of being male increase by 0.35%, holding other variables constant.
While the statistical significance of the coefficient for a dog's age suggests that there is evidence to support the relationship between dog age and the probability of being male,
the practical significance of a 0.35% increase in odds may not be substantial enough to warrant immediate business decisions based solely on this finding.

Further analysis may be needed here. Although the hypothesis was to offer products tailored to the dog's age and gender,
and While age appears to influence sex likelihood, additional factors such as breed, size, and general health complaints would provide a more sound business decision making.
So more investigation into factors would refine predictions.

Identifying Popular Breeds:

    The model can accurately predict the popularity of different dog breeds based on age and sex.
Pet Paradise can use the model predictions to optimize inventory management by stocking up on products that are likely to be in higher demand based on the popularity of different breeds.
For example, if certain breeds are more popular among senior dog owners, Pet Paradise can introduce specialized products such as senior dog food or joint supplements targeted towards that demographic.
