# A. Abstract
This report presents a detailed study led by LinaScarborough, Daniel Herrera and Rina Gandolfi; 
focusing on the demographics of dog ownership in Zurich, Switzerland, using a dataset from the year 2015. 
The dataset, encompassing records from dog owners across various districts, 
serves as the foundation for statistical models aimed at understanding patterns in dog ownership, 
including breed preferences, owner demographics, and spatial distribution.

## Model Development
*Descriptive Statistics*: To outline the basic demographic profiles of dog owners and their pets.

*Spatial Analysis Models*: To explore the geographical distribution of dog 

*Breed Popularity Models*: To identify trends in dog breed preferences among different demographic groups.

*Cluster Analysis*: To segment dog owners into distinct groups based on their preferences and demographics.

*Predictive Models*: To forecast trends in dog ownership and breed popularity.
  Linear Models: Multiple Linear Regression. Interaction Terms. and Non-Linearity
  GAM Models: Generalized Additive Models
  GLM Models: Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression
  ANN: Artificial Neural Networks
  and SVM: Support Vecror Machines

## 1. Overview

Data preparation and preprocessing are essential stages in readying a dataset for predictive analysis. During this phase, our efforts were concentrated on transforming data into a structure that is optimally suited for use in machine learning algorithms, emphasizing the accurate conversion and handling of categorical variables.

## 2. Process Description

### Categorical Variables Inspection

Our preliminary action entailed a thorough examination of the dataset, with a specific emphasis on categorical variables related to dog ownership demographics.

### Code Implementation
Identification of Categorical Variables: 
We initiated our analysis by identifying key variables pertinent to our study (e.g., OwnerGender, DogBreed, OwnerDistrict) that are inherently categorical.
